# Internship 2022
Hello everyone, I have explained the Code Of Conduct for my project here. Just follow the instructions below,

# Description: 
This project is the Virtual Simulator of Web-Enabled Arc Welding Experiment where you can perform the welding of two metal plates by using arc method with the help various other equipments. By performing this experiment, you'll get to know about the whole Arc Welding Process which you performs in the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory.

You can run it by two ways,
* either by navigating the given link [Arc Welding Experiment.](https://raj-official.github.io/Internship-2022/)
* or by pulling the code to your system.

*If you are pulling code on your computer, then follow this way,*
1. Dowload the whole repository in your computer.
2. Open the index.htm file only in your browser.
* NOTE - Do not navigate any file from its original location to somewhere else while pulling the code, as this will corrupt the paths written in the code which may result in experiment failure !

>ONCE YOU OPEN THE INDEX WEBPAGE BY ANY OF THE ABOVE TWO WAYS,

# Steps To Perform "Arc Welding Experiment":
