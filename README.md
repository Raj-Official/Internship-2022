# Internship-2022
Hello everybody, here I'm gonna tell you how to deploy my project and use it flawlessly. Just follow the instructions below,

# Description: 
This project is the Web-Enabled Virtual Experiment of Arc Welding where you can perform the arc welding of two metal plates with the help various other equipments. By performing this experiment you'll get the complete information about practical which you perform in Mechanical Engineering Laboratory.

You can run it by two ways,
    either by navigating the given link 
    or by pulling the code to your system.

If you are pulling code on your computer then follow this way,
    1. Dowload the whole repository in your computer.
    2. Open the index.htm file only in your browser.


# Disclaimers:
1. USE MICROSOFT EDGE BROWSER PREFERABLY FOR BETTER WORKING.
2. DO NOT NAVIGATE ANY OF THE FILE FROM ITS LOCATION TO ANYWHERE ELSE. AS THIS WILL CORRUPT THE PATHS WRITTEN IN THE CODE AND MAY RESULT TO THE EXPERIMENT FAILURE.


ONCE YOU OPEN THE INDEX WEBPAGE BY ANY OF THE ABOVE TWO WAYS,
# Steps To Perform "Arc Welding Experiment":

1. Click on Equipment Details to start the experiment.

2. Click on Objective of Experiment.
